## Bio
I am a Spatial Information Scientist and geographic information systems expert. I specialise in computational approaches to spatial communication problems (communication in and about our spatial environment), in particular with a focus on man-made environments, such as cities. I am currently Lecturer at the Department of Infrastructure Engineering and part of its Geomatics Discipline team at The University of Melbourne, Australia.

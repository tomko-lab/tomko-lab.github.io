## Bio
Youjin Choe joined our group in 2019. Youjin comes with a wealth of experience working with intergovernmental organisations deploying GIS solutions across South-East Asia. She is primarily interested in the impacts of conflict on the efficiency and effectiveness of online open co-production communities (i.e., OpenStreetMap). This is an extremely interesting research that is somewhat distinct to the mostly computational work done in our group, but it is all the more exciting! Youjin in supervised by A/Prof Mohsen Kalantari, and co-supervised by Martin.

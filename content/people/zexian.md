## Bio
Zexian Huang joined our group in 2021, after undertaking his Masters project with Prof Kourosh Khoshelham and Martin. He is continuing his research with the same supervisory team, researching fundamentals of Deep Learning on spatial data. Starting from an original interest in point clouds and computer vision (which are still his primary application areas), Zexian is hoping to contribute new conceptual insights in how the tasks that a model has to undertake, and the types of data available determine the capabilities the models should have. He is applying the new theoretical framework of Geometric Deep Learning.

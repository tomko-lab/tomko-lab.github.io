## Bio
I've got my PhD degree from Latrobe University in 2020. I am now continuing my research as Research Fellow, focusing on the application of geospatial methods for Indigenous archaeology, working on the ARC SRI funded project with the Gunditjmara Traditional Owners at the UNESCO World Heritage Cultural Landscape at Budj Bim.

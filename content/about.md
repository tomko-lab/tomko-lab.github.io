We are a Spatial Information Science/Spatial Data Science research group at the University of Melbourne, led by Dr. Martin Tomko and collaborators. We specialise in conceptual and methodological computational research on the analysis and management of spatial information. This includes research on spatial communication (communication in and about our spatial environment), urban informatics and urban morphology, autonomous interaction with spatial environments, and recently, cultural heritage mapping and interpretation. 

If you are interested in joining our group and tackling exciting spatial problems, read this Website (and in particular, Martin's research interests section), think how you could contribute, and get in touch.

We conduct our research on a number of unceded lands -- primarily on Country of Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation, at Naarm, a place currently called Melbourne. We pay our respects to their Elders past and present.

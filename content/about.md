I am a Spatial Information Scientist and geographic information systems expert. I specialise in computational approaches to spatial communication problems (communication in and about our spatial environment), in particular with a focus on man-made environments, such as cities. I am currently Lecturer at the Department of Infrastructure Engineering and part of its Geomatics Discipline team at The University of Melbourne, Australia. If you are interested in joining my emerging group and tackle some exciting spatial problems, read this and get in touch.

Until recently, I have been Oberassistent (Senior Lecturer) at the GIS Unit (group of Prof. Weibel) of the Department of Geography of the University of Zurich. Previously (until July 2014), I was  Lecturer at the Department of Computing and Information Systems of the University of Melbourne, and the AURIN Manager for Technical Architecture Implementation (in charge of the information infrastructure design and core Technical Team management). The Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN) is now an award winning online data workbench for urban scientists. I provides urban researchers with access to federated datasets and tools to do their research â€“ all in a browser. Check http://www.aurin.org.au to find out more about the wonderful things you could do with AURIN!

Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate at the GIS Section of the Department of Geography, University of Zurich, as part of the EU project Tripod. In the past, I also held various research and development positions in the geospatial industry. I have also been the Technical Lead of the Volunteer initiative BushfireConnect.org, an Australian crowdsourcing platform for emergency information. BushfireConnect provided a moderated emergency information channel, aggregating authoritative and social media information about bushfires. We were the 2011 Telstra Innovation Awards winners.

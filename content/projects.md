# Projects

This is a brief list and summary of the projects undertaken in our group. If you are interested in any of the themes, please get in touch. We are always looking for new and exciting research challenges in computational spatial information science. Whether you are form industry, government, other universities or a student looking for a PhD, please get in touch.

We will progressively add separate sites for each of these projects, summarising the research outputs.

## Current funded projects

- __[2021]__ __Walking the city: Digital infrastructure for pedestrian mobility__ . ARC Discovery project (DP170100153). CIs: Winter; _Tomko_.  AUD \$347,000.

  *Pedestrian access, flow and management are critical for urban life. However, compared to other forms of mobility pedestrian mobility is significantly more complex. Currently, various incompatible pedestrian route graphs in both outdoor and indoor environments render any analysis biased and non-transparent. This project aims to solve this problem by developing a universal and necessarily hierarchical pedestrian route graph to support critical applications such as urban walkability (health), space and asset management (guidance, flow management), and public safety (evacuation). In contrast to conventional algorithms, we will take a novel approach based on human cognition to define this universal graph and then integrate topology and geometry. *
  
- __[2021]__ __Digital breadcrumbs feeding urban decision-making__ . Marsden Fund (Royal Society Te Aparangi,  20-UOA-056). CI:Katarzina Sila-Nowicka (U Auckland, NZ), AIs: Demsar (U St Andrews, UK), _Tomko_. NZD $300,000. 

  __Led by Dr Sila-Nowicka, UAuckland, NZ:__ *In order to publish and use location data in a safe way, human mobility datasets have to be anonymised in a privacy-preserving way. Human mobility science has a huge potential to help the society find solutions to the most pressing contemporary problems – a recent example is contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries around the world – but that cannot be done without access to data. However, neither a unique methodology nor stable qualitative metrics for privacy protection of mobility data exist. There are a number of inconsistently-used metrics describing the quality of anonymization, but these metrics are hard to verify as they are tested on different datasets, thwarting reproducibility. This project will develop new tools for anonymization of movement data.* 
  
- __[2021]__ __Indigenous Engineering: interpreting engineering foundations of Budj Bim__ . ARC SRI project (ARC SRI for Australian Society, History and Culture,  SR200200227). CIs: _Tomko_, Prpic, Khoshelham, Lise-Pronovost, Langton, Bell. AUD $277,000. 

  *The overall aim of this project is to elucidate the traditional engineering processes that enabled the Gunditjmara to site, plan, construct and operate the elaborate eel trapping and aquaculture systems, water channels and settlements at the Budj Bim World Heritage Cultural Landscape. This project will enhance our understanding and conceptualising of Gunditjmara history, technological ingenuity and endeavour by revealing how the system evolved over time. We aim to (1) describe the extent and parameters of the Budj Bim aquaculture system, (2) develop a model of the productivity of the aquaculture system, (3) contribute sophisticated analytical methodologies for archaeology, and (4) provide a visual interpretation of how the site functioned.*
  

## Current unfunded research projects and interests

*This is only an indicative list of work we are doing that is not directly funded (yet...), or is only supported by a scholarship of the University of Melbourne for a PhD student. We would love to branch and grow these streams - help us, please!*

## Past funded projects 

*But, we are still continuing in many of these research streams.*

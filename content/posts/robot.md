We have acquired an exciting new piece of equipment â€“ a Clearpath Robotics Husky Autonomous Ground Vehicle, fully kitted with a variety of sensors, including automotive-standard Velodyne LIDAR. This will be a great boost to our research on autonomous mapping. Get in touch, for all from sensing ( in collaboration with colleagues) to data processing and storage, to coverage planning.

Desired skills:
  * ROS
  * Python/C++/Matlab

The intense first semester is now over for me. I had a great time, interacting with amazing masters students of Spatial Databases and of Spatial Information Programming, and introducing a new generation of students to GIS in the Applications of GIS course. It was a very rewarding period, and I am sure that many of these students will continue in a spatial career.

I have also engaged in cultural heritage documentation, trying a highly unusual deployment of our Husky robot in complex conditions. While the first data collection trip may not have been as optimal as we hoped, we have learned a lot. This will inform a lot of our current research.

And of course, there was intense research activity going on, with a crop of papers out the door. Ehsan and Haonan are making a great progress exploring place-related question answering with conference papers at AGILE and SEMEVAL’19 [1,2]. Ivan’s paper on association rule mining for automated error detection in spatial data has appeared in JOSIS \[6\](part of the ARC DP Self-Healing Maps). Rob, Elham, Nick and I have finally managed to publish our investigation of using spatial mixing models to improve metropolitan scale influenza forecasting (that was a looong review period)[4]. Yet, not as long as the one for [3], which is now showing on the journal website, yet is still not online (pre-print is of course here).

Stephan and I have also engaged with Mike Batty’s commentary in EPB [5], and this has triggered a nice discussion.

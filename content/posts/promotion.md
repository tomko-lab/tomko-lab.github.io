Effective from January 2022, Martin has ben promoted to Associate Professor.

While all promotions are "individual", this is in its entirety the result of a wonderful team effort. I would like to thank my collaborators and students, past and presents, in Australia and overseas, for willing to dive into the marvels of GIScience with me. Thank you for your support, and I hope to equally facilitate your advancements in the years to come.

I would, of course, not have been able to give as much time to research and teaching without a fantastic domestic base. Thank you Miranda, Tamara and Oli for being there for me.

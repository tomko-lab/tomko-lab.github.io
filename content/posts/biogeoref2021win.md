It is with immense pride that we share that our team consisting of Ehsan Hamzei, Kimia Amoozandeh and Kamal Akbari have won the [BioGeoRef2021 Hackaton](https://geocollaboratory.massey.ac.nz/2021/12/17/biogeoref2021-mini-hackathon-won-by-university-of-melbourne-team/), organised as part of the [Spatial Data Science 2021 Symposium](http://sdss2021.spatial-data-science.net/).

They have come with a very clever adaptation of techniques building on years of (primarily) Ehsan's research, and have managed to georeference some 14,000 locality descriptions of species occurence records to a wonderful accuracy of about 10km -- for natural settings and relatively vague descriptions, this is a wonderful level of accuracy!

The team will work on writing up and publishing the method next year, and would be open for new collaborations!

Congratulations, Kimia, Kamal and Ehsan!
